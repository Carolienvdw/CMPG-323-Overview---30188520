# CMPG-323-Overview---30188520
This is the repository that will be used to describe all the projects in my Portfolio of Evidence. Every project will be linked to this repository. 

## Repositories used in projects
Project 1 has the CMPG-323-Overview ---30188520 repository which will be the connection point for all of the remaining Projects. It also has a project called Semester-plan-for-CMPG-323---Kanban-project.
Project 2 will have a repository named CMPG-323-Project2---30188520 and a project named API-Project.
Project 3 will have two repositories named CMPG-323-Project3---30188520 and Classes.
Project 4 will have one repository named CMPG-323-Project4---30188520.
Project 5 will  also have one repository named CMPG-323-Project5---30188520.

## Project and repository context
My Portfolio of Evidence will contain 5 projects as can be seen in the diagram below. These projects will consist out of repositories and/or projects. As described in the diagram below, every project will be linked to the CMPG-323-Overview---30188520 repository. In turn every project of a project will be connected to its own repository and that repository will then be connected to the Overview repository.

## Use of the .gitignore file
I will be using the .gitignore file for my projects. In projects 1, 4 and 5 I will not be using the .gitignore file. In projects 2 and 3 I will be using the .gitignore file to store the credentials of my API project and App to ensure that git does not have access to it.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
In projects 2 and 3 I will need to store credentials that git should not be able to track. I will be using the Git changes Window in Visual Studio and select the 'Ignore this local item' option. This will automatically add this file as an entry in my .gitignore file. This will prevent git form accessing my credentials.


## The branching strategy to be used within each project
I do not have a clearly defined branching strategy, but I will be using the development and the main branches. Knowing that I am the only person working on my projects, I do not see the need in using any other strategy. I will use the develop branch to edit and change my code and then only commit if there are no conflicts or errors.
